In this series, we'll embark on the journey of building your own "digital home" on the internet by exploring the foundational technologies of web development. We'll start by understanding HTML, the structural blueprint of every webpage, emphasizing semantic HTML for clarity and accessibility. Then, we'll delve into CSS, the styling language that allows you to design and customize the visual appearance of your digital space, making it welcoming and user-friendly. Next, we'll unlock the power of JavaScript, the scripting language that adds interactivity and dynamic functionality, bringing your website to life. Finally, we'll learn about ARIA, a crucial set of attributes that ensures your digital home is accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities, by providing essential information to assistive technologies. By the end of this series, you'll have a solid understanding of these core technologies and the principles of building inclusive and well-structured websites.
