# Daniel's A11y blog

Thanks for stopping by my online journal where I ramble on and on about all things accessibility. Here you'll find my ideas, experiences, and other thoughts on my professional life. I'm currently the Accessibility Auditor Team Lead for an online learning company. We're currently diligently working through curricula and remediating them to be as accessible as possible.

I've been learning as much as I can about incorporating accessibility into existing products, tagging PDFs, and offering suggestions for improvements in new features. This is where I'll be recording my discoveries, experiences, and road blocks. If you're finding these entries helpful, think you can help me out, or just want to connect, feel free to contact me through any of the options on my [website (CertReq)](https://certreq.dev/), connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielwestfall/), or email me at <Dwwestfall@protonmail.com>.
