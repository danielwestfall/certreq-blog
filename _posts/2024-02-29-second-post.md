# PDF Accessibility Resources

A new version of the PDF accessibiliy checker is available, and from it's own new website here [PAC 2024](https://pac.pdf-accessibility.org/en). From that rabbit hol I found that you can get free copies of the [PDF ISO 32000-2 (PDF 2.0) bundle](https://www.pdfa-inc.org/product/iso-32000-2-pdf-2-0-bundle-sponsored-access/) through the [PDF Association](https://pdfa.org/).

Now there's no excuse not to have accessible PDFs, unless that is you don't have access to Adobe Acrobat. I wish there was more competition for PDF tagging software. I've seen some programs that let you edit or adjust tags, but nothing solid out there for tagging files from scratch. If someone out there knows of a product that tags better than Acrobat, give me a shout.
