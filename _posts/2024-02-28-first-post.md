# Shout out to MuseScore 4!

For my first entry I'd like to shout out an excellent accessible master work called [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/). I'd point you to their [YouTube Playlist on MuseScore 4 accessibility](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpx1s2WkyujYgLkA0r30sQGjVhWl4NKZ3&si=GEuOQhSHHjXZDec4). The way the software works with NVDA is awesome. I'm also impressed how it exports BRF files for braille music too. If you're in the market for free, yes totally free, and accessible musical notation software then look no further.
