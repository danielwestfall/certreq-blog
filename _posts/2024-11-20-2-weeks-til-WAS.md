# Two weeks until the WAS Exam

I just scheduled my WAS exam for December 4, 2024. I have two weeks left and will be reviewing all the the materials in the Body of Knowledge once again.

I plan on studying a lot over the Thanksgiving holiday here in the US next week. I'll summarize my daily lessons here and after the test I'll finally work more on my programmatic Extended Audio Descriptions. I'll actually work on the code myself rather than attempt go get ChatGPT to understand and actually make a working copy of what I explained.

Later, I plan on filling my YouTube channel with videos going over the CPACC and WAS materials. I also plan on deep dives into each WCAG Success Criteria with examples and more information than the average user would want. From there, who knows what else. Maybe some PDF remediation videos, or even go into accessibility in the built environment. I think User Experience and Usability will be good for case study videos, demonstrating the good and the bad of design and the effect on the end user.

Until next time...
