# Catching Up

It's been a minute since I last posted. Since then, I've passed my CPACC exam and am now certified! I'm currently studying for the WAS exam, and I'm also leading some weekly study sessions with a few of my accessibility peers to help them prepare for their CPACC exams.

I've been considering creating some CPACC training materials, mainly videos, and posting them to my YouTube channel. Honestly, I have too many projects and not enough time! Moving forward, I'll be updating this blog more often, sharing snippets from the scripts I write for the videos and other helpful information.

I'm also brainstorming ways to integrate accessibility more seamlessly into external platforms. Videos or embedded content on your site often introduce accessibility challenges, and I think I have a solution or two up my sleeve.
